# CODSOFT Data Science Internship

This repository contains projects completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship. Each project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.
- Includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- See [`Credit Card Fraud Detection/README.md`](./Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection/README.md) for details and usage instructions.

### 2. Sales Prediction
- Predicts sales based on advertising spend using regression models.
- Includes data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- See [`Sales Prediction/README.md`](./Sales%20Prediction/README.md) for details and usage instructions.

### 3. Movie Rating Prediction
- (Add a brief description here if you want, e.g., "Predicts movie ratings based on various features.")
- See the project directory for more information.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyesh-vataliya/CODSOFT.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies for each project (see their respective README files).
3. Download the necessary datasets as described in each project's README.
4. Run the scripts as instructed in each project directory.

## Note
- Large data files are excluded from the repository. Please download them manually as described in each project's README.

## Git LFS Installation
To handle large data files, Git LFS (Large File Storage) is used. If you haven't installed Git LFS on your system, you can do so by running the following command:
```sh
git lfs install
```
